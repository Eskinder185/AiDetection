# AiDetection
 
This project is a **step-by-step build** of an AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) — designed to detect cyberattacks and network anomalies using **machine learning and deep learning**.  
It demonstrates skills in **AI, cybersecurity, and cloud computing** by evolving from a simple neural network to a fully deployed cloud-based security solution.

##  Project Overview

Modern cyberattacks are often hidden in large volumes of network traffic.  
This project uses **AI techniques** to automatically detect and classify malicious activities using real-world datasets such as **NSL-KDD**.

**Key Capabilities**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for security logs  
- Neural network model trained from scratch (PyTorch)  
- Baseline ML models for performance comparison  
- Visualization (loss curves, confusion matrices, evaluation metrics)  
- Cloud deployment (upcoming: AWS Lambda + Streamlit Dashboard)
